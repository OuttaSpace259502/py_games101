I will be storing my first Python Programs here in this repository.
It won't be anything crazy, but only easy to intermediate programs for beginners.
As I advance, I will create new repositories to document my improvements 
and journey in Python!

Code in Place 2021: Final Project

My final project is a Memory Training Program which aims to help users improve their memory.
It has many different options to choose from. The user can pick between a computer generated sequence or personal input. If computer generated is chosen the user has additional options to choose from which are the following:
- numbers only
- words only
- mixed
- difficulty level

The difficulty level determines how many words/numbers will be shown  to the user to memorize. 

If the user picks personal input, it can choose between 2 options
- default
- vocabulary style

The default version works the same way as the computer generated 'words' option, which basically shows one word at the time for the user to memorize. The only difference is that the user can determine which words will be shown. 
Vocabulary style version consist of pairs key/value pairs. Keyword is followed by a definition or value based on user input. This is perfect for studying vocabulary for school or anything else that needs  a key/value pair.

The last step is to choose an interval for the learning material to appear on to the screen. This option is mandatory for both computer generated and personal input. Depending on the interval chosen the time between i.e. words will be greater or shorter. 

Once the user entered all preferences the i.e.  key/value pairs or numbers will show up one by one on the screen and only disappears once **everything** has been shown. Next the program will asked the user to type in everything in the exact **same** order. 

If the user get the answer wrong, it will have up to 3x try's before it leads to the mad libs part. There the user can choose between 3 different themes:
- body
- car
- house

Next they will be asked to enter visually grotesque verbs, adjectives and nouns. The program will then proceed to generate a mad libs with the computer generated or personal input sequence for the user. Once again the user has 3 try's to enter the write sequence else it will show the already generated mad libs again and it loop until the user exits or get the answer right.

If the answer is correct, the program will congratulate the user and ask the user if it wants to play again or exit. 
The user will have an option to save the sequence **only** if they chose personal input.
